  Hello there! You can call me Long for short. Iâ€™m a currently a master student in Perth, Australia, focused in financial engineering and data science, with the 3-year working experience as a data engineer in Shopee Singapore.

  Beside the current interests, having built a game available on Google Play, this website, and an IEEE journal inspired from my bachelor thesis, I can say I'm an explorer.

  At the moment I'm most in touch with <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Apache Spark</mark>.

  However, the aspect that's I'm most proud of is my resourcefulness and adaptability.

          A bridge that connects a software engineer and a traditional trader in taming the market ... or getting horribly bullied by it.

          My soul personal project of 2022. So far I have built an automated technical trading system; and an options trade semi-bot to follow with trade signal on Github. To request for a demo of my issue ticket & confluence, please contact me.

          I could always see a rift when it comes to high frequency trading for most ordinary people:
            - A software engineer often face problems with understanding financial terms.
            - A traditional retail trader finds building a high quality trading system a formidable task.

          LongNShort aim to eliminate the obstacle: A quality customizable automated trading system with the folling targets in consideration:
            - Well-documented market archive knowledge for an engineer
            - Easy-to-use for a trader, as much as using a script copied from a Youtube channel.

          Made possible with:
            - Tech Stack and Framework: <mark>Python, InteractiveBroker TWS API and Backtrader</mark>
            - Development tracking and knowledge archive: <mark>Atlassian JIRA and Confluence</mark>

      - Normally I'm very lazy (Well, on the positive side they say lazy people often find easy way to solve stuff)
        - For instance, most of the job / experience description above I probably just copy pasted from my documents (You can ask me for official document that I have copied for validation). I don't want to edit it since I blame it for potential Git merge conflict. (Sorry for that NTU section, by the way ^^)
        - I also "borrowed" this website template from a guy called Brett Harris
        - Nonetheless, I can be bribed with fruit juice and food. I believe my productivity is highest when I'm near a pantry.

      Some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Video Game (Welp, certainly not about creating game, one of my nightmare is designing game assets)
      - Manga (I'm NOT an Otaku)
        - I also "borrowed" a OCR translator (Japanese -> English) for reading raw manga in Japanese from leminhyen: <mark>https://github.com/vuduclong0309/Sugoi-Japanese-Translator</mark>
      - Ping Pong (I'm not Chinese btw, I'm Vietnamese)
